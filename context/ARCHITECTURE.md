# ARCHITECTURE.md — System Architecture

## 1. Stack Summary
- Frontend: Blade templates, Tailwind CSS v3, Alpine.js, vanilla JS fetch()
- Backend: PHP 8.2, Laravel 12.6, Eloquent ORM
- Database: MySQL
- Auth: Laravel Breeze (session-based web), Laravel Sanctum v4.3.2 (API token auth for mobile layer)
- Real-time: Laravel Reverb (WebSockets)
- Build: Vite
- Hosting: Hostinger VPS, Ubuntu 22.04, Nginx, Supervisor (Reverb daemon), SSL

## 2. High-Level Overview
AbangananHub is a server-rendered Laravel MVC application. Blade templates render HTML server-side; Alpine.js handles client-side interactivity (dropdowns, modals, toggles, form wizards). Real-time chat uses Laravel Reverb over WebSockets with Laravel Echo on the client. PayMongo handles payment processing via server-side checkout session creation. Cloudinary (v3 SDK) stores public media; local disk stores sensitive identity documents. A scaffolded Sanctum API layer (16 controllers, 30+ endpoints) exists for future React Native mobile clients but is not yet consumed.

## 3. Design Pattern
**MVC (Laravel default)** with the following refinements:
- **Form Request classes** for validation (e.g. `StoreVerificationRequest`, `RejectVerificationRequest`) — keeps controllers thin.
- **Policies** for authorization (e.g. `LandlordVerificationPolicy`) — owner-or-admin checks live here, not in controllers.
- **Middleware** for role gating (`EnsureTenant`, `EnsureLandlord`, `EnsureAdmin`) — registered as aliases in `bootstrap/app.php`.
- **No repository or service layer** — the codebase isn't large enough to justify the indirection. Business logic lives in controllers; if a controller gets fat, it gets a Form Request or a policy extracted, not a service class.
- **Blade components** for reusable UI (`x-stat-card`, `x-section-header`, `x-empty-state`, `x-reservation-card`, `x-verification-status-badge`).
- **Model observers** for cross-cutting side effects, all registered in `AppServiceProvider::boot`: `PropertyUnitObserver` writes an `occupancy_activities` row whenever a unit's `availability_status` changes; `ReservationObserver` broadcasts + notifies on `rental_status`; `PaymentObserver` broadcasts + notifies on payment `status` (with `$afterCommit` so payouts are never announced from inside a transaction). One hook per column covers every transition path, present and future — the rule is that a status column's side effects belong to the observer, never to the call sites that change it.
- **Scheduled commands** (in `app/Console/Commands`, scheduled in `routes/console.php`). Need cron/Supervisor on the VPS; locally run `php artisan schedule:work`.
  - `occupancy:snapshot` (23:55) — per-landlord occupancy history.
  - `reservations:process-move-in-deadlines` (23:00) — backfills Clock 1 deadlines, sends Clock 2 reminders, escalates overdue turnovers, releases expired confirmations. **The only code in the app that moves money with no human present**, hence per-row `lockForUpdate()` + `try/catch`/`Log::error`/continue so one bad row cannot abort the batch. Runs before the snapshot so units it marks Occupied are counted the same night.
- **Dev-only escrow tooling** (`escrow:scenarios`, `escrow:verify`, sharing `Concerns\BuildsEscrowFixtures`). The escrow states are 7–14 days wide and unreachable by using the app normally, so both commands build them by backdating. `escrow:scenarios` creates eight browsable states with login credentials for manual UI checking (`--clean` tears down via the `users.user_id` cascade); `escrow:verify` asserts 33 outcomes and prints a pass/fail table, snapshotting and restoring non-fixture rows first so a run cannot mutate real dev data. Both refuse to run in production.

## 5. Data Flow
### Typical Web Request
Request → Nginx → Laravel Router → Middleware (auth + role) → Controller → Eloquent Model → MySQL → Controller (prepares data) → Blade View → HTML Response

### Real-time Chat
Client JS (fetch POST) → MessageController@store → DB insert → `MessageSent` event (ShouldBroadcastNow) → Laravel Reverb → WebSocket → Laravel Echo (client) → DOM update
- `X-Socket-ID` header sent on fetch to enable `toOthers()` exclusion
- Echo listener uses `.listen('.EventName')` (leading dot) for bare event names

### Payment Flow
Tenant initiates → Controller creates PayMongo Checkout Session (server-side) → Redirect to PayMongo → Webhook callback → Payment record created → Reservation status updated

### Move-In Escrow — two clocks (July 22 2026)
The deposit lands on `payments.status = 'Held'` and is governed by two deadlines that expire in **opposite directions**, so neither party profits from inaction.

```
Tenant pays → Held
  ⏱ Clock 1 (landlord): confirmed handover slot + 7d  [else max(target_move_in_date, paid_at) + 7d;
                          no target date → paid_at + 14d]   capped at original + 30d
      ├─ landlord marks turnover → ⏱ Clock 2 (tenant): 7d
      │     ├─ tenant confirms  → Released (tenant_confirmed)
      │     ├─ tenant disputes  → frozen, admin review queue
      │     └─ silence          → Released (auto_expiry)
      ├─ tenant confirms first (landlord never marked) → Released (tenant_confirmed)
      └─ nobody asserts turnover → escalated to admin review, deposit stays Held
```

**Turnover is assertable by either party.** The landlord marking it starts Clock 2 but moves no money — it is a self-interested claim. The tenant's confirmation releases the deposit immediately *even if the landlord never marked anything*, because a claim against one's own financial interest is the stronger evidence. This is why `confirmMoveIn()` deliberately carries **no** `keys_turned_over_at` precondition; adding one looks like tightening the state machine and would strand landlords who simply forgot the button.

Clock 2 releases only once the deadline **day** has fully passed, not the deadline instant — the tenant is promised the whole calendar day the countdown and reminders name.

**Clock 1 is anchored to a handover slot both parties agree on.** It previously derived from `target_move_in_date`, which `StoreReservationRequest` makes **required at inquiry time**, picked by the tenant alone before the landlord has replied, and which no controller can edit afterwards — so a guess made before the conversation started decided when money escalated, weeks later. `HandoverController` lets either party propose a datetime and the other confirm it (`proposeHandover` / `confirmHandover`); confirming writes `move_in_deadline_at = slot + turnover_grace_days`. Design points that matter:
- **A proposal alone moves nothing.** `move_in_deadline_at` keeps its last confirmed value until a new slot is agreed, so proposing a reschedule can't silently shorten the window the other party is relying on.
- **The proposer can't confirm their own slot** — it feeds an escalation deadline, so agreement has to be real.
- **The cap is measured from the original deadline, not from now** (`handoverDeadlineCeiling()` = `computeTurnoverDeadline() + handover_max_extension_days`). A cap that moves with each reschedule isn't a cap; this way repeated reschedules converge on a fixed outer bound instead of buying another window each time. When the agreed slot would exceed it, the UI says so rather than showing a date nobody chose.
- **No column stores the cap's baseline.** `computeTurnoverDeadline()` derives from `target_move_in_date` and `paid_at`, neither of which ever changes, so the original stays recomputable and doesn't get a second home.
- **`ProcessMoveInDeadlines` is untouched.** `escalateOverdueTurnovers()` already reads `move_in_deadline_at` and `backfillTurnoverDeadlines()` already skips rows where it is non-null, so a confirmed slot simply pre-empts the backfill.
- **`HandoverScheduleUpdated` exists because scheduling moves neither `rental_status` nor payment status**, and those are the only two events the inbox refetches its panel on. Without it, a landlord proposing a time left the tenant looking at a stale strip until reload — the system message arrived live (`postSystemMessage` dispatches `MessageSent`) while the controls to answer it did not. Dispatched from `ReservationObserver` on `wasChanged(['handover_at', 'handover_confirmed_at'])`, conversation channel only (the stage pill doesn't move, so a thread you aren't viewing has nothing to redraw; the bell covers that). **This is the third time this shape has appeared** — payment settling, handover scheduling, and any future state that changes what a party can *do* without changing a status column. When a panel shows some updates live and not others, look for a state change with no broadcast before suspecting the socket.
- **The stepper lives in `conversations/partials/_stage-stepper`, shared by the participants' thread and the admin's read-only view.** "Paid" is derived from payment state rather than stored, so a second copy of that `match()` would eventually disagree about which stage a reservation is in — on the money path. `Admin\ConversationController::show` now eager-loads `activeReservation.payments`; before, an admin arbitrating a move-in dispute could read the messages but not see the stage, the handover schedule, or the escrow state that both participants were looking at. The admin sidebar carries a read-only Move-in & escrow card (escrow amount/status, which clock is running, deadline, handover slot, dispute reason).
- **A proposal awaiting the reader's answer renders as a decision card, not a status line.** `$awaitingMyAnswer` (proposed, not by me, not disputed) promotes the strip into a panel whose body shows the slot at 20px — it is the fact being decided, and as inline 12px prose it was the smallest thing on screen. Primary action is `Confirm Tue, Jul 28 at 9:00 AM` (named in full, so the click is unambiguous), secondary is `Suggest another time`, which opens the picker pre-seeded with the proposed slot. The proposer's own view stays a compact strip reading "You proposed…" with `Change the time you proposed` — deliberately *not* auto-opening a calendar for the receiving party, since landing on one implies they're expected to pick something else when the common case is agreeing.

**Both clocks surface in the conversation thread** via `conversations/partials/_move-in-clock`, included by `chat-panel` in the `Rental Agreement Signed` + held-payment branch for each role. They ran nightly and rendered on the agreement page from the start, but Messages — where the two parties actually coordinate the handover — said only "Payment received and held", so the deadline that decides where the money goes was invisible in the room where the work happens. The partial picks the live clock off `isTurnoverClock()` and words it for the viewer (landlord: "Turn over the keys to Axcee by Aug 6"; tenant: "Your deposit is held. Maria should turn over the keys by Aug 6"), tinting teal → red at ≤1 day and amber when disputed. **The landlord's "Mark keys turned over" button rides along** — it starts Clock 2, so it belongs beside the countdown waiting on it. It reuses the same route, Gate and confirm copy as the Reservations index: a second entry point, not a second implementation. Durations stay in `config/rentals.php` — global, not per-agreement, so there is one place to change them and nothing for the tenant to have to re-read before signing.

**KNOWN BUG — landlords cannot create units (found July 23, 2026; root cause identified July 24, 2026; still not fixed).** The cause is not a *missing* migration but a **misnamed** one: `2026_07_18_022220_add_unit_type_floor_deposit_description_to_property_units` adds none of the columns its filename names — its body is a single `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY COLUMN availability_status` for the `Maintenance` enum member. It is recorded as run, so `migrate` shows nothing pending and `migrate:fresh` reproduces the gap. **Do not "re-run" that migration expecting the columns; write a new one.** SCHEMA.md documented all three as existing for months purely because the filename said so — the two docs contradicted each other until `Schema::hasColumn` settled it. `PropertyUnit::$fillable` declares `unit_type`, `floor` and `security_deposit`, `Landlord\PropertyUnitController::store()`/`update()` validate and write all three, and **no migration defines any of them**. A create therefore throws `SQLSTATE[42S22] Unknown column 'unit_type'` — verified in a rolled-back transaction. Existing units came from seeders. Reads fail silently instead (a missing attribute returns null), so `agreements/show` has a "Security deposit" row that can never render, `OccupancyController` reports null deposits, and the units CSV exports blanks. The fix is one migration adding the three columns; check `landlord/units/create` for the intended types first.

**Phase 1 limitation:** Clock 1 expiry escalates to a human rather than auto-refunding, because PayMongo's programmatic refund support is unverified. The admin queue therefore drains only via release-to-landlord; there is **no refund action anywhere in the app**. What can honestly be promised a tenant today is "an admin will review it", not "you get your money back". See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-22-move-in-confirmation-window-design.md`.

### Post-Auth Destination
Every auth entry point — login, registration, both `VerifyEmailController` paths, the verification prompt, verification resend, and password confirm — resolves its redirect through `User::homeRoute()`: Admin → `admin.dashboard`, Landlord → `landlord.dashboard`, everyone else → `properties.index`. New accounts carry no role until Tenant is granted on first browse, so they fall through to the listings as well.
**There is no tenant dashboard and no bare `dashboard` route** — only `admin.dashboard` and `landlord.dashboard` exist. Adding a role means adding its home to `homeRoute()`; every auth entry point then follows automatically.

### Password Reset
Login modal "Forgot Password?" → in-modal email form → AJAX POST to `password.email` → `PasswordResetLinkController@store` (returns JSON when `wantsJson()`, otherwise redirects with a flash) → modal swaps to a "check your email" view → Laravel writes the token to `password_reset_tokens` → `User::sendPasswordResetNotification()` is overridden to send `PasswordResetMail` (a branded Mailable) instead of the framework's default notification → emailed link opens the full-page `auth/reset-password` view (a fresh page load from an email, so it can't be a modal) → `password.store` → redirect to login with a success flash.
Throttling is the framework's, not custom: `config/auth.php` → `passwords.users.throttle` = 60s between requests per email, `expire` = 60 minutes.

### File Upload (Cloudinary)
Form submit (multipart) → Controller → `cloudinary()->uploadApi()->upload($file)` (v3 SDK) → Cloudinary CDN URL stored in DB (`media_url` column)

### Unit Photos — Live Capture
Unit create requires photos: **≥3 must be live camera captures** (anti-fraud — proves the unit is real/current), uploads are extras (≤10 total). Client-side `getUserMedia` draws frames to a canvas → `toBlob` → injected into an aggregated `photos[]` file input via `DataTransfer`, kept index-aligned with `photo_sources[]` (camera|upload) and `photo_captions[]` hidden inputs. Controller validates the alignment and the live-count, then persists `source` + `caption` per `unit_media` row. Requires HTTPS or localhost (browser constraint).

## 6. Key Decisions Log

| Decision | Reason | Date |
|---|---|---|
| Session-based auth (Breeze) over Sanctum SPA | Simpler for server-rendered Blade; Sanctum reserved for API layer | Early 2026 |
| Reverb over Pusher | Free, self-hosted, no third-party dependency for capstone | Early 2026 |
| Text search over Haversine radius | Cebu-scoped platform doesn't need geo-radius — address text match is sufficient | Mid 2026 |
| No service/repository layer | Codebase not large enough to justify indirection; Form Requests + Policies keep controllers manageable | Mid 2026 |
| Conversations table kept (not sender/receiver direct) | Already built and tested; rewrite would regress real-time chat | Mid 2026 |
| Cloudinary over S3 | Better free tier, simpler SDK for image transforms, appropriate for capstone scale | Mid 2026 |
| Local disk for gov't IDs, Cloudinary for public media | Identity docs must not be publicly accessible; policy-gated download route handles access | Mid 2026 |
| Property → Units (multi-unit model adopted) | PM requirement for bedspace/room granularity; partial adoption without Business entity layer | Mid 2026 |
| PayMongo sandbox over direct GCash API | Broader payment method coverage through single integration; easier sandbox signup for students | Mid 2026 |
| Ocean Teal palette replacing Gold Black | Stronger brand identity, better WCAG compliance, cohesive with glassmorphism spec | July 2026 |
| Glassmorphism UI spec | Distinctive visual identity for defense; bg-white/70 backdrop-blur-xl consistent across ~55 views | July 2026 |
| **Glassmorphism retired app-wide for flat cards** | The analyst prototype's flat, structured look read as clearer and more trustworthy than frosted panels; translucency was fighting the soft shadows and muddying dense data views. One `<x-card>` component now owns the card spec. Teal mesh gradient dropped for a flat `#F7FCFC` background. Palette unchanged — prototype's blue/purple accents map onto the locked Ocean Teal set, color reserved for status | July 2026 |
| face-api.js for liveness detection | Runs client-side (no server GPU needed), works on Chrome/Firefox, sufficient for capstone | Mid 2026 |
| **Liveness step 4: "Look up" replaced "Open your mouth"** | Mouth detection read the inner-lip landmarks (62/66), the least accurate points in the *tiny* 68-point model, and needed an unnatural 0.3 gape. Pitch uses nose/eye-line/chin, which the tiny model places reliably. Pitch has no scale-free absolute like yaw does, so step 1 ("Look straight") records the applicant's own resting ratio as a baseline and step 4 requires a delta from it — per-user calibrated instead of a fixed threshold. Chose a sustained look-up over a nod: one threshold, same hold-pattern as turn-left/right, and a nod is no harder to spoof since a tilted printed photo produces both phases | July 2026 |
| **Verification is live-capture only; upload path removed** | The upload path set `faceCheckDone = true` and skipped liveness entirely, so a stored photo of someone else's face and ID would reach admin review — liveness was effectively optional. Camera-only closes it. Cost: desktops without a webcam can't apply, accepted since the flow targets mobile | July 2026 |
| **Verification wizard rebuilt as a step rail + stage** | It shipped as a 672px `max-w-2xl` column with each step in a white card — on a 1866px screen that's a phone layout parked in the middle of a desktop, and the card framed a camera feed that was already a rectangle. Now `max-w-[1400px]` split into a sticky 248px rail listing all five steps and a stage that drops the card. The rail collapses to the original horizontal bar below `lg`, so mobile is unchanged. Rejected a plain widen-and-decard (fixes the frame but strands ~1,100px) and a two-column-only split (fixes the space but leaves the 5-step shape invisible between screens) | July 2026 |
| `liveness_passed` flagged fallback over a hard block | face-api.js loads from a CDN at runtime, so an outage would otherwise lock out every applicant. Manual capture stays available but records `liveness_passed = false`, and the admin verification screen shows a warning banner — routing the risk to the human review that already gates every application | July 2026 |
| Live camera capture required for unit photos | Anti-fraud — proves the unit is real and current; ≥3 live captures, uploads as extras | July 2026 |
| Two-column unit create/edit (form + sticky-preview rail) | Fills wasted horizontal space; live preview + amenities in the rail | July 2026 |
| Occupancy history via nightly snapshots + observer-based activity log | True daily trend needs stored history; observer catches every status-change path without touching each controller | July 2026 |
| CSV export on landlord list pages (Units, Reservations, Tenants) | Reuses the existing `response()->streamDownload()` + `fputcsv` + `chunk(200)` pattern from `OccupancyController::export()` — streamed so a large portfolio never builds the file in memory. Each controller extracts its filter logic into a private `filteredQuery(Request)` shared by `index()` and `export()`, so a CSV always matches what the page is showing and the two can't drift apart. Buttons pass `request()->only(...)` to carry the active filters | July 2026 |
| Landlord list pages: analyst-prototype data tables + grid/table toggle | Reservations rebuilt as filterable table (search/property/date-range in controller); Units/Properties/Reservations each got a client-side view toggle persisted in localStorage; both views render server-side and swap via x-show, per-record derived data precomputed once per page | July 2026 |
| Public property page restyled to analyst prototype (flat cards) | Three-column layout, flat white cards — was an exception at the time, became the app-wide reference once glassmorphism was retired (DESIGN.md §6e); Inquiry/Reserve toggle is presentational (single reservations.store flow) | July 2026 |
| Mobile inquiry: sticky bar + two-step teleported modal | Desktop sidebar is hidden <lg, so phones had no inquiry path; modal shares Alpine selectedUnit state with sidebar, posts to same reservations.store | July 2026 |
| Inbox chat panel: pinned inquiry summary card | Unit photo/price + Inquiry Details (move in/out, message) pinned atop thread for both parties; landlord header shows tenant email/phone + New Inquiry badge | July 2026 |
| Password reset request lives in the auth modal; the reset step is a full page | Matches the existing AJAX login/register modal flow; the reset form arrives from an email link (fresh page load) so it can't be a modal | July 2026 |
| Branded Mailable over Laravel's default reset notification | Framework default is unstyled and off-brand; reuses the `VerificationLinkMail` + `resources/views/emails/` pattern already in the codebase | July 2026 |
| All post-redirect flash messages render through one global modal | The three app layouts each auto-fired a modal **and** 11 page views rendered their own inline banner, so a single flash could show twice; `partials/flash-modal.blade.php` is now the only place session flashes are read | July 2026 |
| Controllers flash sentences, not status slugs | Breeze's `'password-updated'` / `'profile-updated'` slugs leaked as literal text once flashes were routed through a generic modal | July 2026 |
| WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility pass | Accessibility was in the RULES.md checklist but never enforced; 76 inputs had a visible label with no `for`/`id` pairing and were nameless to screen readers | July 2026 |

| Tenant dashboard removed — tenants land on `/properties` | It was already orphaned (no link to it in any live layout's nav), every widget duplicated a dedicated page that was in the header anyway, and its `$recentActivity` section was a permanent empty placeholder. Tenants browse; they don't operate a control panel. Landlords and admins keep their dashboards | July 2026 |
| Notification modal raised to `z-[9998]` | At `z-50` it rendered *below* the public layout's `z-[100]` sticky header — the header stayed bright and clickable over the dimmed backdrop — and tied with the admin/landlord sidebar, winning only on DOM order. A blocking dialog must outrank passive UI (header, slideout, lightbox, toasts); only the auth modal (`z-[9999]`) sits above it | July 2026 |
| Notifications go through one factory, `Notification::notify()` | The pipeline was effectively dead: `Notification::create` existed in exactly **three** places, all `ReviewController`, so a new review was the only event in the entire app that produced a notification — an active landlord with 14 properties still had an empty bell. `ConversationController::show` was already marking `type = 'message'` notifications read, proving message notifications were designed and never built. Every creation site now calls `Notification::notify()`, which writes the row **and** dispatches `NotificationCreated`, so the broadcast can't be forgotten — the same failure that left `postSystemMessage()` writing rows nobody saw. Rental-lifecycle notifications hang off `ReservationObserver` (created + status transitions), so one hook covers both parties across all seven transition methods | July 2026 |
| Landlord "Reports" split into **Analytics** (Insights) and **My Complaints** (Account) | One word meant two unrelated things. `landlord.reports.index` was a *complaint tracker* — reports the landlord filed — while the prototype's Reports/Analytics nav means rental-business performance. Now: `landlord.analytics.*` is the performance page, `landlord.complaints.*` is the filed-report history (route + view directory renamed). Reports filed *against* a user remain admin-only; `Landlord\ReportController` already scoped to `reporter_id`, so there was never a leak there. Revenue is sourced from `payments` (`Held` + `Released`, dated by `paid_at`) joined through reservations — previously surfaced nowhere for landlords. Charts reuse the established Chart.js 4.4.0 CDN pattern (5 other views) rather than adding a dependency | July 2026 |
| "Paid (held)" is a **derived** stepper stage, not a `rental_status` value | The fact already lives in `payments.status = 'Held'`. Mirroring it into `rental_status` would give one fact two homes that can disagree — if the PayMongo webhook writes the payment row but a reservation write fails, you'd have a paid reservation that renders as unpaid, on the money path. `rental_status` is also enumerated across 20 files (count arrays, `validStatuses`, filter tabs, analytics buckets, `PropertyUnit`), and a missed one silently drops reservations out of a tab. The stepper renders 6 nodes from `rental_status + payment state` instead: `Rental Agreement Signed` maps to stage 4 ("Paid") when a Held/Released payment exists, else stage 3. **The tradeoff accepted:** landlords can't filter their reservation list by "awaiting move-in" without a payments join | July 2026 |
| Tenant move-in confirmation releases the escrow; admin release kept as override | `confirmMoveIn()` flipped the reservation to Occupied and left the payment on `Held` **forever** — money only reached the landlord if an admin noticed and clicked Release on the admin Payments screen. The release now happens in the same locked transaction as the status flip, with `released_by = null` marking a platform release vs an admin id for a manual one. `Admin\PaymentController::release` stays for disputes and stuck webhooks | July 2026 |
| Agreement page: print-to-PDF via Tailwind `print:` variants, not a `<style>` block | A rental agreement the tenant cannot keep a copy of is a gap for a document they're asked to sign. RULES.md bans inline `<style>`, so the print sheet is built from `print:hidden` on chrome/actions and `print:border-none print:shadow-none` on the card, plus a footer carrying the agreement ref that only appears in print. Also added an `AGR-YYYY-NNNNN` reference and a signature block surfacing `agreed_at` / `agreed_ip` / `landlord_tc_accepted_at` — all three were already captured in the DB and never displayed | July 2026 |
| `PaymentStatusUpdated` broadcast so the agreement page's "Payment Processing" state is honest | The page told the tenant "This page will update once the payment is verified" while nothing polled or listened — the PayMongo webhook lands out-of-band, so the spinner sat there forever. The webhook now dispatches on `user.{tenant}`/`user.{landlord}` and the page reloads. A full reload is deliberate: the page has five mutually exclusive server-rendered states and re-rendering one in JS would duplicate the Blade | July 2026 |
| Rental-status changes broadcast a *signal*, not markup; each client refetches its own render | The chat panel renders differently per role (landlord sees "Accept & negotiate", tenant sees "Waiting for landlord"), so there is no single HTML payload correct for both parties — and reimplementing the role×status matrix in JS would have duplicated ~150 lines of Blade branching that would immediately drift. `ReservationStatusUpdated` carries only ids + status; the client re-fetches `GET /conversations/{id}` (which already returned the per-viewer partial for the inbox's AJAX loading) and swaps it in, preserving the draft message and scroll position | July 2026 |
| **`PaymentObserver` broadcasts payment transitions, not the four settle sites** | Paying left the conversation stepper on "Signed" until a reload. "Paid" is a *derived* stage — `chat-panel.blade.php` computes it from a `Held`/`Released` payment while `rental_status` stays `Rental Agreement Signed` — so paying never changes `rental_status`, `ReservationObserver` never fires, and `PaymentStatusUpdated` is the only signal that can move the stepper. Four places settle a payment (PayMongo webhook, the checkout-return handler that polls PayMongo when the webhook hasn't landed, admin release, the move-in deadline command); each dispatched the broadcast by hand and **the return handler never got the call** — and that is the only path that runs locally, since PayMongo can't reach `localhost`. It also skipped the two notifications the webhook raised. The observer hooks `updated` + `wasChanged('status')`, same shape as `ReservationObserver`. It sets **`$afterCommit = true`**, which preserves what the hand-written dispatches were doing deliberately: every release path wraps its update in a transaction and announced the payout only after commit, because a rolled-back payout must not be broadcast. That flag also replaces `Admin\PaymentController`'s `$shouldBroadcast` guard — a rolled-back release never reaches the observer at all. Symptom worth remembering: the system message ("completed the initial payment") *did* arrive live because `postSystemMessage()` dispatches `MessageSent`, so the thread moved while the stepper beside it didn't — **a partially-live view usually means two signals where one is wired and one isn't, not a broken socket** | July 2026 |
| `PaymentStatusUpdated` carries `conversation_id` + a derived `stage` | The event only knew about `user.{tenant}`/`user.{landlord}` and sent `payment_id`/`reservation_id`/`status`, so the inbox had no way to map it to a list row — the sidebar stage pill stayed stale even when the webhook did fire, and the handler's `refreshPanel()` returned early whenever no thread was open. It now also broadcasts on `conversation.{id}` (mirroring `ReservationStatusUpdated`, since the stepper lives in that panel) and carries the stage computed the same way the Blade computes it, so the two can't disagree about what "Paid" means. Channel split follows the existing convention: `user.{id}` updates rows for threads you're *not* viewing, `conversation.{id}` re-renders the open panel | July 2026 |
| `ReservationObserver` broadcasts the transition, not the seven transition methods | `Reservation` has seven methods that change `rental_status` (advanceToNegotiation, advanceToPendingAgreement, signAgreement, markOccupied, confirmMoveIn, reject, cancel), all ending in `save()`. Hooking `updated` + `wasChanged('rental_status')` means no transition — present or future — can change status without notifying the other party. Same pattern as `PropertyUnitObserver` | July 2026 |
| Inquiry form validation split: field errors inline, state rejections to the flash modal | `properties/show` had **no `$errors` block at all**, so all five of `Tenant\ReservationController::store`'s `withErrors()` calls redirected back and rendered nothing — the form silently did nothing. Date rules moved to `StoreReservationRequest`; `target_move_in_date` is now `required` (it was `nullable`, which made `after:target_move_in_date` on move-out skip entirely — Laravel drops the rule when the referenced field is null, which is how a move-out *before* move-in shipped). Operational rejections (unit taken, duplicate inquiry, own listing) now flash `error`/`warning` per RULES.md; only date/message errors render inline | July 2026 |
| `User::homeRoute()` is the single post-auth destination | Login resolved the role inline while registration and email-verification hardcoded `route('dashboard')`, so the same tenant got a different home depending on whether they registered or logged in; all 8 redirect sites now call one method | July 2026 |
| `Model::preventLazyLoading` + Debugbar (dev-only) as N+1 safety nets | A latency hunt confirmed controllers are already N+1-clean (consistent `with()`/`load()`, incl. nested Blade access), but nothing *enforced* it going forward. `preventLazyLoading(! app()->isProduction())` in `AppServiceProvider::boot()` now throws on any lazy load in local/dev; `barryvdh/laravel-debugbar` (require-dev, auto-follows `APP_DEBUG`) shows per-request query counts. Rule of thumb: a page >25 queries in Debugbar warrants a look | July 22 2026 |
| Local dev must use `127.0.0.1`, never `localhost` (Windows) | A flat ~500ms floor on every request traced to Windows resolving `localhost`→IPv6 `::1` first while services bind IPv4, eating a ~500ms–1s fallback per connection. Fixed four stacking causes: `REVERB_HOST` → `127.0.0.1` (1009ms→2ms); enabled OPcache incl. `enable_cli` in `php.ini` (cold recompile per `artisan serve` request, ~500ms→~50ms); browse via `127.0.0.1:8000`; and deleted a **stale `public/hot`** (leftover from a killed `npm run dev`, pointing at dead `[::1]:5173`) that made Firefox stall on every asset. Convention: IPv4 everywhere in `.env`, Vite `server.host = '127.0.0.1'`, check `ls public/hot` if pages go slow/unstyled | July 22 2026 |
| `guzzlehttp/guzzle` bumped 7.14.0 → 7.15.1 | Cleared 4 medium-severity advisories (referer/cookie/proxy-header leakage, cookie DoS). Minor bump, no API change. `composer audit` now clean — worth running periodically | July 22 2026 |
| Escrow deposits get **two** deadlines, expiring in opposite directions | A held deposit had no deadline at all: nothing forced the tenant to confirm, so a landlord who had already handed over the keys waited indefinitely for money that was technically paid, and the only fix was an admin releasing by hand. One clock would have been worse than none — a tenant-only deadline lets a landlord stall while the tenant's money sits locked. Clock 1 (landlord turnover) and Clock 2 (tenant confirmation) now expire toward opposite parties, so silence is never the winning move for either side | July 22 2026 |
| Clock 1 derives from `target_move_in_date`, not a flat timer | A deposit for a move-in next week and one for a move-in in two months cannot share a countdown. Deriving from the date **both parties already negotiated** also makes the deadline defensible in a dispute — we enforce their commitment plus a grace period, not an arbitrary platform rule. Rejected making the window itself negotiable: unlike a move-in date it is adversarial (landlord wants it long, tenant short), and the landlord usually wins that argument, which would quietly gut the protection | July 22 2026 |
| `release_reason` added rather than overloading `released_by` | `released_by = null` already meant "released by the platform on tenant confirmation". Auto-expiry is *also* a platform release with a null actor, so it would have silently collided — losing exactly the distinction needed when a tenant disputes a payout months later | July 22 2026 |
| Header nav (Browse / Areas / How it works); Areas derived live via a view composer | The header had no nav at all. **Browse** and **How it works** point at pages that exist (`properties.index`; `about#how-it-works` — that section was already written, it just had no `id`). **Areas had no page and no data model** — addresses are free text — so rather than build one, the menu is derived from live listings: the city is the second-to-last comma segment of each approved listing's address, counted and cached 10 minutes. An address not in `Barangay, City, Cebu` shape contributes no area rather than a wrong one, and the listing stays browsable either way. A `View::composer('layouts.app')` supplies it because the header renders on every public page and a controller that forgot to pass it would drop the menu silently. Nav sits beside the logo, not centred — the collapsed search pill is `absolute left-1/2` and would sit under it on scroll. Desktop only; this header has no mobile menu and phones have no nav today either | July 24 2026 |
| Browse page rebuilt as hero + grid; search extracted to `<x-search-pill>` | `/` and `/properties` are the same route, so the browse page is the site's front door and opens on a hero (DESIGN.md §6i). The search pill and category strip already existed inline in `layouts/app`; the hero needed both, and copying them would have created a second copy of a form whose field names the controller reads — the `conversations/show` failure. Extracting them fixed two live bugs on the way: the pill discarded its own values on submit, and the strip's `category-link`/`data-type` hooks had **no JS anywhere**, so it never showed an active filter | July 24 2026 |
| `daysUntilMoveInDeadline()` uses `(int) round(...)`, not `(int)` | Carbon 3 returns a **float** from `diffInDays()` — verified `4.0000000001157` for a 4-day difference. The cast is required because the reminder thresholds use a strict `in_array($days, [4,1,0], true)` and `4.0 !== 4`; but bare truncation would silently drop a day if the FP noise ever landed just below an integer, and a tenant would lose a warning before an automatic payout. Do not "simplify" this cast away | July 22 2026 |

**Bugs this surfaced (all pre-existing, all fixed July 2026):** `<x-guest-layout>` was referenced by four auth views but the component never existed (the layout lived at `layouts/guest.blade.php` with no alias), so `auth/login`, `auth/register`, `auth/forgot-password` and `auth/reset-password` all 500'd when visited directly. The auth modal carried `transition-all scale-100 opacity-100 duration-300` as static classes that never changed, so its animation never fired. `components/login-modal`, `register-modal` and `success-modal` were never rendered anywhere, and three "Login" buttons on `properties/show` dispatched `open-modal` at that dead component — clicking them did nothing. The tenant-dashboard removal turned up more of the same: `layouts/navigation.blade.php` (Breeze scaffolding) was included by nothing while holding three links, its `x-nav-link`/`x-responsive-nav-link` components were used only by it, a second unrouted `App\Http\Controllers\DashboardController` sat alongside `Tenant\DashboardController` rendering the same view, and `landlord/verification/show` linked a pre-role applicant at the tenant dashboard. All deleted or repointed.

**Another orphan, same class (found and deleted July 2026):** `resources/views/conversations/show.blade.php` — 459 lines, never rendered. `ConversationController::show()` returns the `chat-panel` partial for AJAX and *redirects to `conversations.index`* otherwise, so the view was unreachable while the `conversations.show` **route** stayed heavily linked (5+ views) and working. It was a full second implementation of the chat panel — its own header, its own vertical stepper, its own copy of the role×status action matrix, its own inline Echo wiring — quietly diverging from the live partial. Note the tell: a live *route* is not evidence of a live *view*.

**Recurring lesson:** grep for *every* reference before deleting a route or view, and re-grep after editing. Several of these were only found by baselining references first, and one `replace_all` edit silently missed a second occurrence that differed only by indentation.

## 7. Known Tradeoffs
- **No queue worker** — `ShouldBroadcastNow` is synchronous. Acceptable for capstone load; would need a queue for production scale.
- **No caching layer** — No Redis/Memcached. DB queries are fast enough at capstone data volumes.
- **No rate limiting on API** — Sanctum API layer is scaffolded but not rate-limited. Non-issue until mobile app ships.
- **Single admin** — No admin role hierarchy or permission granularity. One admin account handles everything.
- **No automated testing** — Manual testing only. Time constraint; automated tests are a post-defense improvement. The one exception is `escrow:verify`, a self-checking Artisan command covering the money paths — not a test suite, and deliberately not PHPUnit (that would need four factories and a MySQL test database, since the migrations use raw `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY COLUMN` and SQLite in-memory cannot run them).
- **PowerShell dev environment** — Compound artisan/tinker commands with `$` variables are unreliable; workarounds required.
- **Escrow is simulated** — PayMongo sandbox handles payment capture, but the escrow hold-and-release logic is application-layer simulation, not a real escrow service.
- **No refund path** — nothing in the app writes `payments.status = 'Refunded'`. Clock 1 expiry therefore escalates to admin review instead of auto-refunding, and the admin queue can only drain by releasing to the landlord. Whether PayMongo supports programmatic refunds is **unverified** and must be confirmed before that gap can close.
